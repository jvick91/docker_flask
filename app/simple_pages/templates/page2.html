    <h1>Docker and Dockerhub</h1>
    <h2>Containers</h2>
    <p>A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.</p>
    <h2>Images</h2>
    <p>Are the instruction set used to create containers. Once created they are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed and are used as a set of instructions to build apps. The same image can and should be reused in different projects for many reasons. One of them being that it saves the developer plenty of time by not having to rewrite monotonous code. It also offers a stable environment to test new code in. If the developer knows that the base image is well made, then they do not have to troubleshoot it if the problem arises. 	If the project is large enough, it can also save plenty of disk space as it will not be repeated throughout the project. An image needs to contain all of the frameworks and dependencies needed to run the application.</p>

<h2> How to Start a project via command line</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Open terminal of choice</li>
    <li>Use command “cd <directory path>” to choose in which directory the folder should be located in. If no project exists, use either command “docker pull <image name>” or “git clone <repository name>” to download the file.</li>
    <li>Use the cd command to enter the directory and then type “docker build -t <choose what to name the image></li>
    <li>docker run -dp 3000:3000 <what the image was named in the step before></li>
    <li>Use “docker -it <image name> sh” to access terminal and run commands inside of the container</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>How to open a container via command line</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>In cmd, use command “docker ps -a” </li>
    <li>This will show all containers that we ran. Copy the container id of the image required. </li>
    <li>Use command <docker exec -it <container id> bash</li>
    <li>Can use a simple command like “ls” or “uptime”</li>
    </ol>
